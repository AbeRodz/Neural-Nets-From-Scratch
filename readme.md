# Neural Networks from Scratch

This repository aims to practice neural networks concepts from scratch, by implementing matrix operations and later constructing a neural net for x problem, the most probable would be using the MNIST dataset to classify digits.

# Todos

1. Finish the necessary matrix operations
    - Optimize code
    - Test
2. Build a simple NN
3. Test on MNIST
